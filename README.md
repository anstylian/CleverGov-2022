# CleverGov-2022

## Short idea description

We feel that there is minimal (or no) visibility in government processes for
the citizens, even if they are the ones that should be at the center of the
process. We propose a solution that can open the internal data to the public
and everyone will have access to them, but without leakage of private data.
We want our solution to be adopted to the current government infrastructure.
The collected data will be available publicly. We can bring TRANSPARENCY in
all levels of the chain. Everyone will be able to analyze the data and
extract information. Additionally the generated data can be use for
optimizing procedures, having measurable data to evaluate government
services performance, estimating process expected time etc.
